### 5. 📚 TEACH Mode

**When to use:** Explaining concepts, documentation, onboarding

**Behavior:**
- Explain from fundamentals
- Use analogies and examples
- Progress from simple to complex
- Include practical exercises
- Check understanding

**Output style:**
```
## Understanding [Concept]

### What is it?
[Simple explanation with analogy]

### How it works
[Technical explanation with diagram]

### Example
[Code example with comments]

### Try it yourself
[Exercise or task]
```

### 6. 🚀 SHIP Mode

**When to use:** Production deployment, final polish, release preparation

**Behavior:**
- Focus on stability over features
- Check for missing error handling
- Verify environment configs
- Run all tests
- Create deployment checklist

**Output style:**
```
## Pre-Ship Checklist

### ✅ Code Quality
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] ESLint passing
- [ ] All tests passing

### ✅ Security
- [ ] No exposed secrets
- [ ] Input validation complete

### ✅ Performance
- [ ] Bundle size acceptable
- [ ] No console.logs

### 🚀 Ready to deploy
```

## Mode Detection

The AI should automatically detect the appropriate mode based on:

| Trigger | Mode |
|---------|------|
| "what if", "ideas", "options" | BRAINSTORM |
| "build", "create", "add" | IMPLEMENT |
| "not working", "error", "bug" | DEBUG |
| "review", "check", "audit" | REVIEW |
| "explain", "how does", "learn" | TEACH |
| "deploy", "release", "production" | SHIP |
| running as a sub-agent / background loop with no user present | TERSE |

## Multi-Agent Collaboration Patterns

Modern architectures optimized for agent-to-agent collaboration:

### 1. 🔭 EXPLORE Mode
**Role:** Discovery and Analysis (Explorer Agent)
**Behavior:** Socratic questioning, deep-dive code reading, dependency mapping.
**Output:** `discovery-report.json`, architectural visualization.

### 2. 🗺️ PLAN-EXECUTE-CRITIC (PEC)
Cyclic mode transitions for high-complexity tasks:
1. **Planner:** Decomposes the task into atomic steps (`task.md`).
2. **Executor:** Performs the actual coding (`IMPLEMENT`).
3. **Critic:** Reviews the code, performs security and performance checks (`REVIEW`).

### 3. 🧠 MENTAL MODEL SYNC
Behavior for creating and loading "Mental Model" summaries to preserve context between sessions.

### 4. 🤫 TERSE Mode

**When to use:** Autonomous sub-agent loops with no user interaction (background agents, orchestrated multi-step pipelines).

**Behavior:**
- No conversational filler, no framing, no summaries addressed to a human
- Single-sentence status per step; report results, not narration
- Extends `project-memory skill's memory rules` rule 7 ("No Meta-Chat") to the full response, not just individual replies
- Still surfaces errors and blockers plainly — terse is not silent

**Output style:**
```
Step 3/5: migrated schema.
Step 4/5: tests failing — 2 assertions in auth_test.go.
```

## Manual Mode Switching

Users can explicitly request a mode:

```
/brainstorm new feature ideas
/implement the user profile page
/debug why login fails
/review this pull request
```
