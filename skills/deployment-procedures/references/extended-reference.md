### Verification Window

- **First 5 minutes**: Active monitoring
- **15 minutes**: Confirm stable
- **1 hour**: Final verification
- **Next day**: Review metrics

## 5. Rollback Principles

### When to Rollback

| Symptom | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Service down | Rollback immediately |
| Critical errors | Rollback |
| Performance >50% degraded | Consider rollback |
| Minor issues | Fix forward if quick |

### Rollback Strategy by Platform

| Platform | Rollback Method |
|----------|----------------|
| **Vercel/Netlify** | Redeploy previous commit |
| **Railway/Render** | Rollback in dashboard |
| **VPS + PM2** | Restore backup, restart |
| **Docker** | Previous image tag |
| **K8s** | kubectl rollout undo |

### Rollback Principles

1. **Speed over perfection**: Rollback first, debug later
2. **Don't compound errors**: One rollback, not multiple changes
3. **Communicate**: Tell team what happened
4. **Post-mortem**: Understand why after stable

## 6. Zero-Downtime Deployment

### Strategies

| Strategy | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| **Rolling** | Replace instances one by one |
| **Blue-Green** | Switch traffic between environments |
| **Canary** | Gradual traffic shift |

### Selection Principles

| Scenario | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| Standard release | Rolling |
| High-risk change | Blue-green (easy rollback) |
| Need validation | Canary (test with real traffic) |

## 7. Emergency Procedures

### Service Down Priority

1. **Assess**: What's the symptom?
2. **Quick fix**: Restart if unclear
3. **Rollback**: If restart doesn't help
4. **Investigate**: After stable

### Investigation Order

| Check | Common Issues |
|-------|--------------|
| **Logs** | Errors, exceptions |
| **Resources** | Disk full, memory |
| **Network** | DNS, firewall |
| **Dependencies** | Database, APIs |

---

## 8. Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|----------|-------|
| Deploy on Friday | Deploy early in week |
| Rush deployment | Follow the process |
| Skip staging | Always test first |
| Deploy without backup | Backup before deploy |
| Walk away after deploy | Monitor for 15+ min |
| Multiple changes at once | One change at a time |

---

## 9. Decision Checklist

Before deploying:

- [ ] **Platform-appropriate procedure?**
- [ ] **Backup strategy ready?**
- [ ] **Rollback plan documented?**
- [ ] **Monitoring configured?**
- [ ] **Team notified?**
- [ ] **Time to monitor after?**

## 10. Best Practices

1. **Small, frequent deploys** over big releases
2. **Feature flags** for risky changes
3. **Automate** repetitive steps
4. **Document** every deployment
5. **Review** what went wrong after issues
6. **Test rollback** before you need it

---

> **Remember:** Every deployment is a risk. Minimize risk through preparation, not speed.
