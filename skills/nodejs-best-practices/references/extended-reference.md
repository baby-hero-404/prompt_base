### When to Simplify:
- Small scripts → Single file OK
- Prototypes → Less structure acceptable
- Always ask: "Will this grow?"

## 4. Error Handling Principles

### Centralized Error Handling

```
Pattern:
├── Create custom error classes
├── Throw from any layer
├── Catch at top level (middleware)
└── Format consistent response
```

### Error Response Philosophy

```
Client gets:
├── Appropriate HTTP status
├── Error code for programmatic handling
├── User-friendly message
└── NO internal details (security!)

Logs get:
├── Full stack trace
├── Request context
├── User ID (if applicable)
└── Timestamp
```

### Status Code Selection

| Situation | Status | When |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Bad input | 400 | Client sent invalid data |
| No auth | 401 | Missing or invalid credentials |
| No permission | 403 | Valid auth, but not allowed |
| Not found | 404 | Resource doesn't exist |
| Conflict | 409 | Duplicate or state conflict |
| Validation | 422 | Schema valid but business rules fail |
| Server error | 500 | Our fault, log everything |

---

## 5. Async Patterns Principles

### When to Use Each

| Pattern | Use When |
|---------|----------|
| `async/await` | Sequential async operations |
| `Promise.all` | Parallel independent operations |
| `Promise.allSettled` | Parallel where some can fail |
| `Promise.race` | Timeout or first response wins |

### Event Loop Awareness

```
I/O-bound (async helps):
├── Database queries
├── HTTP requests
├── File system
└── Network operations

CPU-bound (async doesn't help):
├── Crypto operations
├── Image processing
├── Complex calculations
└── → Use worker threads or offload
```

### Avoiding Event Loop Blocking

- Never use sync methods in production (fs.readFileSync, etc.)
- Offload CPU-intensive work
- Use streaming for large data

---

## 6. Validation Principles

### Validate at Boundaries

```
Where to validate:
├── API entry point (request body/params)
├── Before database operations
├── External data (API responses, file uploads)
└── Environment variables (startup)
```

### Validation Library Selection

| Library | Best For |
|---------|----------|
| **Zod** | TypeScript first, inference |
| **Valibot** | Smaller bundle (tree-shakeable) |
| **ArkType** | Performance critical |
| **Yup** | Existing React Form usage |

### Validation Philosophy

- Fail fast: Validate early
- Be specific: Clear error messages
- Don't trust: Even "internal" data

---

## 7. Security Principles

### Security Checklist (Not Code)

- [ ] **Input validation**: All inputs validated
- [ ] **Parameterized queries**: No string concatenation for SQL
- [ ] **Password hashing**: bcrypt or argon2
- [ ] **JWT verification**: Always verify signature and expiry
- [ ] **Rate limiting**: Protect from abuse
- [ ] **Security headers**: Helmet.js or equivalent
- [ ] **HTTPS**: Everywhere in production
- [ ] **CORS**: Properly configured
- [ ] **Secrets**: Environment variables only
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Regularly audited

### Security Mindset

```
Trust nothing:
├── Query params → validate
├── Request body → validate
├── Headers → verify
├── Cookies → validate
├── File uploads → scan
└── External APIs → validate response
```

---

## 8. Testing Principles

### Test Strategy Selection

| Type | Purpose | Tools |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Unit** | Business logic | node:test, Vitest |
| **Integration** | API endpoints | Supertest |
| **E2E** | Full flows | Playwright |

### What to Test (Priorities)

1. **Critical paths**: Auth, payments, core business
2. **Edge cases**: Empty inputs, boundaries
3. **Error handling**: What happens when things fail?
4. **Not worth testing**: Framework code, trivial getters

### Built-in Test Runner (Node.js 22+)

```
node --test src/**/*.test.ts
├── No external dependency
├── Good coverage reporting
└── Watch mode available
```

---

## 10. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:
- Use Express for new edge projects (use Hono)
- Use sync methods in production code
- Put business logic in controllers
- Skip input validation
- Hardcode secrets
- Trust external data without validation
- Block event loop with CPU work

### ✅ DO:
- Choose framework based on context
- Ask user for preferences when unclear
- Use layered architecture for growing projects
- Validate all inputs
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Profile before optimizing

---

## 11. Decision Checklist

Before implementing:

- [ ] **Asked user about stack preference?**
- [ ] **Chosen framework for THIS context?** (not just default)
- [ ] **Considered deployment target?**
- [ ] **Planned error handling strategy?**
- [ ] **Identified validation points?**
- [ ] **Considered security requirements?**

---

> **Remember**: Node.js best practices are about decision-making, not memorizing patterns. Every project deserves fresh consideration based on its requirements.
